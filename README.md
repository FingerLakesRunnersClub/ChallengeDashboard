# FLRC 2021 Club Challenge Dashboard

Throughout 2021, the Finger Lakes Runners Club Challenge will open 10 race courses to local runners to test their mettle against one another and as part of 10-year age-group-based teams, all while staying safe from the coronavirus. Awards and bragging rights wonâ€™t just go to the swift, but also to the consistent, the persistent, and the clever.
